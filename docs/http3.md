# HTTP/3 Protocol

## Here are 20 popular sub-topics related to HTTP/3

1. QUIC Protocol: HTTP/3 is built on top of the QUIC protocol, which is a transport layer protocol designed to reduce latency and improve network efficiency.

2. Multiplexing: HTTP/3 supports multiple concurrent requests over a single connection, allowing for improved performance and reduced latency.

3. Server Push: HTTP/3 allows servers to push resources to clients before they are requested, which can improve page load times and reduce latency.

4. TLS 1.3: HTTP/3 requires the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 for encryption and authentication.

5. Congestion Control: HTTP/3 includes a built-in congestion control mechanism to prevent network congestion and improve overall network performance.

6. Stream Prioritization: HTTP/3 allows for stream prioritization, which can help ensure that the most important requests are processed first.

7. Connection Migration: HTTP/3 allows for connection migration, which means that a client can switch to a new network path without interrupting ongoing requests.

8. HTTP/2 Compatibility: HTTP/3 is designed to be compatible with HTTP/2, which means that existing applications and APIs can be easily migrated to HTTP/3.

9. Performance Improvements: HTTP/3 is designed to improve overall performance, especially in scenarios where network latency is high.

10. Stateless Retry: HTTP/3 includes a feature called stateless retry, which can help improve the reliability of connections in the presence of packet loss.

11. Reduced Head-of-Line Blocking: HTTP/3 reduces head-of-line blocking, which means that requests can be processed independently and in parallel, even if some requests are blocked.

12. Middlebox Compatibility: HTTP/3 is designed to be compatible with middleboxes, such as firewalls and proxies, which can sometimes interfere with network traffic.

13. Connection Establishment: HTTP/3 uses a different connection establishment process than HTTP/2, which can improve overall connection latency.

14. Server Name Indication (SNI): HTTP/3 includes support for SNI, which allows servers to host multiple domains on a single IP address.

15. Connection Termination: HTTP/3 uses a different connection termination process than HTTP/2, which can improve overall performance and reduce latency.

16. Security Improvements: HTTP/3 includes several security improvements, such as improved encryption and better protection against attacks.

17. Caching: HTTP/3 supports caching, which can improve overall performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

18. DNS Lookup: HTTP/3 includes support for encrypted DNS lookup, which can improve security and privacy.

19. Load Balancing: HTTP/3 supports load balancing, which can help distribute requests across multiple servers to improve overall performance and reduce latency.

20. Resource Prioritization: HTTP/3 allows for resource prioritization, which can help ensure that critical resources are loaded first, improving overall page load times.
